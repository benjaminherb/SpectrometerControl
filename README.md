# SpectrometerControl

Scripts to directly measure from matlab using the SpectraScan PR670.

Use measure.m for a simple way to get measurements from the spectrometer and save them as .json or auto_measure.m to automate measurements using matlab to show predefined colors.

Alternatively the Spectrometer.m class can be used to implement in your own scripts.
